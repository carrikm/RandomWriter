# RandomWriter
A command-line application that takes in a .txt file and randomly writes out as many words as requested. 

There are 3 copies to implement and highlight the difference in effectiveness of different data structures:
 -ArrayList (RandomWriter)
 -Binary Search Tree (RandomWriterBST)
 -HashMap (RandomWriterHash)

Additionally, the text files that were used are available along with the comparison data and a very brief results write-up.
